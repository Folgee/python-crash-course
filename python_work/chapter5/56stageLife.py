#ALGORITHM
#1. create variable 
#2. star if statemetns, with another var in each block that assigns age
#3. program will run thorugh test becase of age
#4. out put will be a print message inluding var that was made in our if block




age = 87 


if age < 2:
    kind = 'baby'

elif age < 4:
    kind = 'toddler'

elif age < 13:
    kind = 'kid'

elif age < 20: 
    kind = 'teenager'

    kind = 'adult'

elif age > 65: 
    kind = "dam son you old, you're an elder "

#PROBLEM ASKED IN BOOK
#age < 2, print person is a baby 
#age < 4, print person is a toddler
#age < 13, print person is a kid
#age < 20, print person i s a teenager 
#age < 65, print person is a adult 
#age > 65, print person is a elder 

#UPDATE
#I noticed that my code seems more effecient compared to the answer 
#on the book. They repeat themselves to much using print functions

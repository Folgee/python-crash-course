odd_numbers = list(range(1, 20, 2))

for number in odd_numbers:
    print(number)


#LINE 1 - list 'oddNumbers' is created using list() and genertaed odd nums using range()
#LINE 3 - for loop is made and temp var 'number' is created which then becomes
#         associated to 'oddNumbers'
#LINE 4 - still in loop we print using temp var 'number'

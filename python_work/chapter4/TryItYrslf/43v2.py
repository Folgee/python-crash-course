for values in range(1, 21):
    print(values)



# PROBLEM - create a for loop that prints out numbers 1 through 20

#LINE 1 - for loop is created with a temp var 'values' as is associated a range function
#         that will generate a list of nums from 1 to 20


#LINE 2 - print function is inside forloop and prints out 'values'due to being associated to
#         range function which gnerated nums previously
